# ThePeopleSearchApplication
Health Catalyst Take Home Assessment

Hello, thank you for this opportunity to show off my programming skills. 

How to use the website:
I made a .txt file that contains the profile of around 40 book and movie characters, formatted by separating each attribute by tabspace, and each person by a new line.
Read in the file (medFile1.txt) and search for someone! When you push the search button, it simulates a slow search by showing a loading circle for 3 seconds, then shows the profile of whoever is currently at the top of the list.

The requirements for this assessment specified that I use .Net technologies, ORM framework, etc. After slaving over this assessment for five days, trying to learn how to do all of that, scouring the internet, turning to friends for help, I decided it was too much to learn in under a week. During the phone interview, my interviewer, Tali Ramos, told me that I am not expected to be an expert and know how to do everything, and that I should just do my best. So I changed directions and successfully made a people search application using just the standard HTML/CSS/Javascript. I'm keeping my two .cs classes just in case you want to see my work in C#, even though I don't use them.

Thank you for your time, I look forward to hearing back!

Hope W.
